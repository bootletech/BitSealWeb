  headline: <strong>Meet Barry<span class="light">,&nbsp;</span></strong><span
    class="light">the Bit Seal.</span>
  content: Barry uses three different cryptography keys to provide end-to-end encryption,
    digital signatures, and password-less authentication. <br><br>
    Barry's strength comes from the
    hardware security modules found in almost all newer smartphones. Using the
    technology already built into your phone, BitSeal combines three cross-encrypted
    keys to form a proprietary system that ditches passwords while eliminating threats from
    phishing and malware.<br><br>
    <strong>tl;dr</strong> Barry is security simplified.
