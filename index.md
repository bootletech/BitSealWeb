  headline: <strong>Meet Barry<span class="light">&nbsp;</span></strong><span
    class="light">the Bit Seal</span>
  content: Barry is an app for your smartphone which utilizes three different
    cryptographic keys to provide end-to-end encryption,
    digital signatures, and password-less authentication. <br><br>
    Barry's strength comes from the
    hardware security modules found in almost all newer smartphones. Using the
    technology already built into your phone, BitSeal combines three cross-encrypted
    keys to form a proprietary system that ditches passwords while eliminating threats from
    phishing and malware.<br><br>
    <strong>tl;dr</strong> Barry is security simplified.

  headline: ... and his home, <span class="light"><span
    class="light"></span><strong>The Big Bit Ocean</strong>
  content: The Big Bit Ocean is a centralized identity authority for the BitSeal
    network. The Ocean automatically downloads the encryption and signature keys
    needed to send encrypted emails, and check the validity of a BitSeal
    signature. <br> <br>
    The Ocean maps keys to verified BitSeal user's identities.
    An end user knows exactly who they are sending and receiving emails from. <br> <br>
    <strong>Phishers can't catch anything in this ocean.</strong>

    headline: Digital Signatures
    content: With a BitSeal Digital Signature, any email or document can become electronically
      "sealed" to any modification or forgery. The recipient can be sure that the email or document
      is legitimately from the sender, and digitally signed documents meet the most stringent
      requirements of the E-Sign Act, identical to a "wet signature" in US courts.

    headline: Encrypted Communications
    content: Hackers and foreign governments are becoming a major threat to the security of
      intellectual property, proprietary technology, and sensitive records. BitSeal provides
      end-to-end encryption for all of your communications, ensuring no one (including us),
      can read your sensitive communication.

    headline: Passwordless Authentication
    content: In 2004, Bill Gates boldly predicted the death of the password. Yet over
      <script>new Date().getFullYear()>2010&&document.write(new Date().getFullYear()-2004);</script>
      years later, we are still using one of the most insecure and inconvenient methods of authentication.
      With BitSeal you can log into websites, applications, and even your computer with just your
      smartphone, no passwords required.
